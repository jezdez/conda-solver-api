"""Core resolving logic using conda's solver API.

This module performs dry-run solves: it resolves a set of package specs
against conda channels and returns fully-pinned package metadata
(versions, builds, SHA256 hashes, URLs) without downloading or
installing anything.

Performance notes:
    - ``build_index()`` caches ``RattlerIndexHelper`` objects keyed by
      ``(channels, platform)``.  Building an index (~700 ms) is the
      dominant cost of a solve; the cache reduces repeat solves to just
      the SAT time (~20-100 ms).  ``index_lock`` makes check-then-build
      atomic, preventing thundering-herd on cold or cleared caches.
      Call ``clear_index_cache()`` to invalidate all entries.
    - Multi-platform solves run in a persistent ``ProcessPoolExecutor``
      to bypass the GIL. Workers retain their own index caches across
      requests.
    - All arguments to ``solve_one_platform`` are plain strings/tuples
      so they serialize cheaply for cross-process dispatch.
    - ``ResolvedPackage`` and ``SolveResult`` are ``msgspec.Struct``
      subclasses, which are faster to instantiate and use less memory
      than dataclasses.  Both the HTTP API and the CLI's default
      output encode them directly via ``msgspec.json`` — there is no
      intermediate ``dict`` conversion.  The CLI's ``--format`` path
      feeds conda's exporter plugins with ``Environment`` objects
      (via ``solve_environments``) instead.

Security notes:
    - ``run_solver`` is protected by ``platform_lock`` so that
      concurrent threads (from ``anyio.to_thread``) cannot race on the
      conda ``context`` singleton state.
    - Solver errors are caught and wrapped via
      :func:`conda_presto.exceptions.safe_error_message` so that only
      an allow-list of known exception types surfaces its detail to
      API clients; everything else returns a generic message.  Full
      detail is still logged server-side.

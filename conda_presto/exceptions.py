"""Centralized exception types and error-sanitization helpers.

Keeping these in one place makes it easy to audit which error types
conda-presto defines (currently just :class:`UnknownFormatError`) and
which known-safe exception types it re-surfaces to HTTP clients.

``SAFE_ERROR_TYPES`` is the allow-list of exception classes whose
``str(exc)`` is considered user-actionable and safe to return to
clients.  Anything not in the list is sanitized via
:func:`safe_error_message` to a generic message; full detail still
lands in the server logs.
